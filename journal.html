	<h1>JOUNRAL ENTRY 1</h1>

	<div class="item"> <a  style="color:rgb(244, 186, 255);">So far computer science has been really fun. In the past, there has always been a part of me that was scared of coding, and I always thought I could never do it. It is because of what I have learned that I am here, writing a journal entry on my webstie that I made myself. Although it can definetly be challenging at times, it only makes me feel prouder of my work once I have completed something. I am really excited for the rest of my time in this course!</a></div>
