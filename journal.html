	<h1>JOURNAL ENTRY 1</h1>

	<div class="item"> <a  style="color:rgb(244, 186, 255);">So far computer science has been really fun. In the past, there has always been a part of me that was scared of coding, and I always thought I could never do it. It is because of what I have learned that I am here, writing a journal entry on my webstie that I made myself. Although it can definetly be challenging at times, it only makes me feel prouder of my work once I have completed something. I am really excited for the rest of my time in this course!</a></div>

	<h2>JOURNAL ENTRY 2</h2>

	<div class = "item"> <a style="color:rgb(244, 186, 255);">I am currently working on my first codesketch, a TV show 2048 game. I have created my grid and score board, but am still figuring out the rest! The next codesketch I plan on working on is a trivia game. It has been really fun working on my website and I am so excited for the final product!</a></div>
